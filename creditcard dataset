# Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset

## Dataset Overview
This dataset contains credit card transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013, with 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions (0.172% fraud rate). The data is highly imbalanced with frauds representing only a small fraction of all transactions.

## Dataset Characteristics
- **Number of Instances**: 284,807 transactions
- **Number of Features**: 31 (28 anonymized + Time, Amount, Class)
- **Imbalance Ratio**: 1:578 (fraud:genuine)

## Feature Information
1. **Time**: Seconds elapsed between transaction and first transaction
2. **Amount**: Transaction amount
3. **Class**: Target variable (1 = fraud, 0 = genuine)
4. **V1-V28**: Principal components from PCA transformation of original features

## Data Source
Originally from Worldline and the Machine Learning Group of ULB (Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles)

## Usage
This dataset is intended for:
- Fraud detection model development
- Imbalanced classification research
- Anomaly detection studies

## Preprocessing Notes
- All features except Time and Amount are PCA-transformed
- Original features are anonymized for confidentiality
- Amount feature should be scaled before modeling

## Suggested Modeling Approaches
- Handle class imbalance using:
  - SMOTE oversampling
  - Class weighting
  - Anomaly detection methods
- Evaluate using metrics like:
  - Precision-Recall AUC
  - F1-score
  - Confusion matrix
